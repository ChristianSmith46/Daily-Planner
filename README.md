# Daily-Planner Module 5 Challenge
In this module the goal was to create a daily planner that displayed events that are occuring.  In doing so we were required to use local storage in order to have the data persist on refresh.  Each hour should show a different color depending on the current time.  The top of the page must also show the current date.
